# NodeBB Topics Admins Plugin

This plugin allows users to add admins in a topic. Topics admins can edit main post.

# Usage

Users can allow other user to edit his post using a special "BBCODE" tag. Example:
[admins]@oneadmin@otheradmin[/admins]

Between "[admins]" and "[/admins]", the user must mention the users that he wants that become admins.

This is a beta version, soon we will do a button to do it easier.

# Compatibility
NodeBB 0.7 or newest
